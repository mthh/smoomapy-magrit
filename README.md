#### Smoomapy-magrit

Slightly faster and more memory-efficient [smoomapy](https://github.com/mthh/smoomapy) implementation (*stewart potentials*, as offered in [Magrit](https://github.com/riatelab/magrit) or [SpatialPosition](https://github.com/Groupe-ElementR/SpatialPosition) for example) at the expense of maintainability.

Dropped here to (probably) be installed as a python dependency when building Magrit from now and until another solution is found.
